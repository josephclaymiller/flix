### Notes
I encountered a challenge loading the images because I was using HTTP instead of HTTPS. Xcode gave an error which I researched online and found a solution was to set `Allow Arbitrary Loads` to `YES` under `App Transport Security Settings` in `Info.plist`. This removed a security requirement Xcode had in place and worked to load the images, however, I later realized that there was no need to change the app settings as I hadn't copied the base URL correctly and I actually should have been using HTTPS.
